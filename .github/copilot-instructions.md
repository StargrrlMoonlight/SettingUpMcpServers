This is a React todo-list web application built with Vite. The design should maintain:

- Neutral light color palette for an exclusive, high-end aesthetic
- Dark classical fonts for headlines and important text
- Clean, minimalist design principles
- Modern UI components with subtle shadows and elegant spacing
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile

## Styling Guidelines

- Implement dark, classical fonts (like serif or elegant sans-serif) for headlines
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography hierarchy
- Use subtle animations and transitions for a polished feel
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility

## Technical Stack

- React with functional components and hooks
- Vite for build tooling
- CSS Modules or styled-components for styling
- Local state management for todo items
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
