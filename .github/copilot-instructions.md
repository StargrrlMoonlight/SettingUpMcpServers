# Copilot Instructions

<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

This is a React todo-list web application built with Vite. The design should maintain:

- Neutral light color palette for an exclusive, high-end aesthetic
- Dark classical fonts for headlines and important text
- Clean, minimalist design principles
- Modern UI components with subtle shadows and elegant spacing
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile

## Styling Guidelines

- Use a neutral color palette with light grays, off-whites, and subtle warm tones
- Implement dark, classical fonts (like serif or elegant sans-serif) for headlines
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography hierarchy
- Use subtle animations and transitions for a polished feel
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility

## Technical Stack

- React with functional components and hooks
- Vite for build tooling
- CSS Modules or styled-components for styling
- Local state management for todo items
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Repository Information

- **GitHub Repository:** StargrrlMoonlight/SettingUpMcpServers
- **Project Type:** React Todo-List Application Tutorial
- **Local Path:** /Users/moonlight/Documents/Projects/Tutorials/SettingUpMcpServers
- **Active Issues:** Check GitHub issues for current development tasks and feature requests

## Development Workflow

### Issue-Driven Development
- **Always create a GitHub issue first** before starting any new feature or bug fix
- Every pull request must reference a corresponding GitHub issue
- Use descriptive issue titles with emojis for visual categorization
- Include detailed acceptance criteria and technical considerations in issues

### Branch Management
- **Always create a new feature branch** when implementing GitHub issues
- Branch naming convention: `feature/issue-{number}-{short-description}`
  - Example: `feature/issue-5-drag-drop-reordering`
  - Example: `feature/issue-3-due-dates-priority`
- Never work directly on the main branch
- Delete feature branches after successful merge

### Pull Request Process
- Create pull requests that reference the GitHub issue (e.g., "Closes #5")
- **Always assign GitHub Copilot as a reviewer** for automated code analysis
- Include screenshots or demos for UI changes
- Ensure all tests pass and code follows the established style guidelines
- Request human review after Copilot review is complete
- Address all feedback before merging
- Delete feature branches after successful merge
